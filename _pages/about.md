Hi, I am a junior student in Electrical Engineering (EE), expecting to change major to Control, Robotics and Autonomy (CRA) by 2026 Fall at **Virginia Tech**. I am actively applying for undergraduate research in robotics.

Previously, I transferred from **Sichuan University**, Chengdu, P.R.China, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

I have experience working on infrared thermography for cancer-related studies and medical image-based fracture diagnosis, advised by Dr. Jeungphill Hanne. Also, I have experience working on the fNIRs data based classification for Alzheimer’s Disease, advised by Dr. Zheng Yang.
