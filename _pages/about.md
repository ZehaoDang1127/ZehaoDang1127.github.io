Hi, I am a junior student in Electrical Engineering (EE), expecting to change major to Control, Robotics and Autonomy (CRA) by 2026 Fall. I am actively applying for undergraduate research in robotics.
Previously, I transferred from Sichuan University-Pittsburgh Institute, Chengdu, P.R.China, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
